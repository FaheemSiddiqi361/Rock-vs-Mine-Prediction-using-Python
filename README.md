# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-using-Python

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. The dataset contains features extracted from sonar signals bounced off these objects. The model is trained to classify the objects into two categories: "R" for rock and "M" for mine.

The project follows these steps:

Loading and exploring the dataset.

Preprocessing the data, including splitting it into training and test sets.

Training a machine learning model (likely a classification model) to predict whether the object is a rock or a mine.

Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.

Making predictions on unseen data.

Dropping unnecessary columns (e.g., categorical columns) to ensure proper model input format.
